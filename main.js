// A new civilisation has been found! Remarkably, their language is identical to English but with one key difference: their proper nouns (words with one capital letter: e.g London) are all reversed. We need a translator to help us communicate with them.

// Your task is to write a function named 'capitalReverse', which takes a string and reverses all words within that string which contain exactly one capital letter.

// Any words within the string which contain no capital letters or more than one capital letter should be ignored (not reversed).

// The string should be returned with the sentence in its orignal order, with only the matching words reversed (a matching word contains exactly one capital letter)

// For example: 'this should not be reversed' should be left unchanged as there are no words with capital letters.
// Whereas: 'sihT should be reversed' should become 'This should be reversed'. With 'sihT' reversed as it contains exactly one capital letter.

// Good luck !

// The input for all tests will be a string.

// Please write your function below

export function capitalReverse(string) {
  // write your code here
}
